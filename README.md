## The purpos of this repo
To track my solutions to the [Projet Euler challenges](https://projecteuler.net/).

### 01 Multiples of 3 or 5.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### 02 The sum of even fibonacci numbers under 4,000,000.
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### 03 Largest prime factor.

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

### 04 Largest Palindromic Numbers

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### 05 Smallest Multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

[Solution](https://github.com/GiveMePseudonyms/Project_Euler/blob/main/Project%20Euler/P5_Smallest%20Multiple.cs)

### 06 Square of the Sums

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  1^2 + 2^2 +... 10^2 = 385
  
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  (1+2+3+...10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
  3025 - 385 = 2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
