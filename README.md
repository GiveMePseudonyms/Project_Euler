## The purpos of this repo
To track my solutions to the [Projet Euler challenges](https://projecteuler.net/).

### Multiples of 3 or 5.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### The sum of even fibonacci numbers under 4,000,000.
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Largest prime factor.

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?
